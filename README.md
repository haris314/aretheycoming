A mobile responsive website to organize events. People join groups. People can then make events in the groups and vote in events. They can see other group membersâ€™ votes updated in real-time. Admins of groups can accept/reject other people's requests, make new admins, and remove existing members. Users can see their active events on their feed.
The purpose is to keep track of how many people will likely be present in an event like a college lecture.


**How to use this platform?**
1. Sign up.
1. Search for groups you want to join.

1. Once you are accepted, you can vote in that group's events or create your own events in the group which will be visible to all the members of that group.
1. An admin of the group is authorized to promote other members to admin or remove them from the gorup.
